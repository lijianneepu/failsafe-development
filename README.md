Resilient Power Distribution Networks for rural electrification and Zero energy buildings

The idea is to develop fault prediction, fault diagnosis and fault remediation algorithms and hardware solution 
for next generation power distrinution networks which are automated yet emotionally designed,
cost-optimized yet reliable, efficient yet robust and most of  above all safe and affordable.

In this repository, you will find algorithms for fault diagnosis of switching power converters, PV panels,
batteries and network faults.

Moreover, we have hardware solutions for highly reliable power electronics converter with fault remediation strategies.
